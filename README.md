# Automated OWASP WebGoat Vulnerability Scanning with ZAP DAST

Welcome to the project! This CI pipeline automatically scans OWASP WebGoat for vulnerabilities using ZAP DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing). Itâ€™s all automated via GitHub Actions and Docker, ensuring a smooth and consistent process whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Overview

The pipeline does the following:
- Builds the project using Maven.
- Scans the code for security flaws with Semgrep.
- Runs WebGoat in a Docker container.
- Performs a ZAP scan on the running app.
- Archives the results of the ZAP scan.

## How It Works

### 1. **Build & Static Analysis**
The pipeline first builds the Java project with Maven and then scans the code for security issues using Semgrep.

- **Checkout the code**.
- **Set up JDK 17** (for building the project).
- **Build the project using Maven**.
- **Upload the build artifact** (WebGoat app) so it can be downloaded in the next step to build the Docker container.
- **Run Semgrep scans** to check for security vulnerabilities both in the code and its dependencies.
